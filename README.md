# Checklist

### Week 1
- [x] Create a git repository
- [x] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
- [ ] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages
- [x] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
- [ ] Fill out the make_dataset.py file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
- [ ] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
- [ ] Remember to fill out the requirements.txt file with whatever dependencies that you are using
- [ ] Remember to comply with good coding practices (pep8) while doing the project
- [ ] Do a bit of code typing and remember to document essential parts of your code
- [ ] Setup version control for your data or part of your data
- [ ] Construct one or multiple docker files for your code
- [ ] Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended
- [ ] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments
- [ ] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
- [ ] When you have something that works somewhat, remember at some point to to some profiling and see if you can optimize your code
- [ ] Use Weights & Biases to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code. Additionally, consider running a hyperparameter optimization sweep.
- [ ] Use Pytorch-lightning (if applicable) to reduce the amount of boilerplate in your code
