<h1>Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations</h1>
<p>This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:</p>
<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>markdown
![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>will generate an <code>.html</code> page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate an <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final handin.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.</p>
<p>For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with <code>pip install click markdown</code>.</p>

<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>19</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s213820, s184677, s144841, s230374</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the <code>torchvision</code> framework, and specifically the <code>models</code> module, which provides a suite of pre-defined model architectures and even pre-trained weights. We have used the pre-defined model GoogLeNet found <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/googlenet.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a default, the model is set up with an output dimension of 1000, to classify the ImageNet dataset. The dataset we use only has 10 classes, so it is necessary to specify this when instantiating the model.</p>
<p>We initialize the weights randomly, as we are interested in training the model ourselves and conduct experiments with regard to the training process.</p>
<p>Using the out-of-the-box model from torchvision was a great help in getting started with the project, as it required minimal code and only small adjustments to make it work. One important thing is that the input dimension is of the correct shape - image should be 3 color channels and size should be minimum 224 in the case of GoogLeNet, as described in the documentation <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_googlenet/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have used the Conda package manager to manage dependencies. The environment.yml file contains everything that is needed to run and develop the project. To get a copy of the environment, the new team member would simply have to clone the repository, and then use the command <code>conda env create -f environment.yml</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, the environment may change over the course of development, so it should be commited frequently to the repository.</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em>
Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our code is structured using the MLOps cookiecutter template. Everything that is run as part of the project is in the project folder, while everything else (data files, model files, config files) are in the root directory.</p>
<p>We have filled out the following folders: data, dockerfiles, models, notebooks, reports, tests, and of course the project itself (animals10).</p>
<p>In addition to these, we also added a config folder, which holds the YAML files for setting up experiments. We also have a cloudbuild folder, which contains the YAML file that builds the docker image for deploying the model.</p>
<p>We have not filled out the docs folder, since this is just a demo project not meant for long-term maintenance. However, for documentation, we have tried to comment code and make use of docstrings where relevant.</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these</strong>
<strong>concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For formatting we have used ruff linting and formatting. Additionally, we have written docstrings for the trickier/more complex parts of the code. It is important to document the work in larger projects, because otherwise your colleagues (and future-you) will not understand the code. This leads to technical debt in the long-term. Documenting code ad hoc is an investment, but it will lead to much better, understandable and maintainable code in the future.</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 7 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 8 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For small changes, commits directly to the main branch with a descriptive message was tolerated. However, if the code change spanned more than just a few lines, we made use of branches and PRs. This enables everyone to see which changes are in progress, and what parts of the project are being actively developed.</p>
<p>We did not really implement a single naming convention for the branches. One naming convention is "type/subject". And so, if we were developing the training script, the branch would be "feature/trainmodel". Other types could be <em>bugfix, experimental, WIP</em>.</p>
<p>Another naming convention is to use the ititials of the developer, and then the subject, e.g. "john/trainmodel". This was, everyone can easily see who is working on what.</p>
<p>For smaller projects, like this one, it can also be alright to just use the subject of the branch as the name, e.g. "trainmodel". But for larger projects it is good to have a naming convention.</p>
<p>PRs are used to merge temporary branches into the main branch, and are a good way to describe in natural language the changes made in the branch. The author can highlight important changes, and explain concepts. However, documentation within the code itself should also be present for future debugging.</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We did not use Data Version Control (DVC) in our project, mainly because our dataset remained fixed and did not undergo changes throughout the experiments. However, in scenarios where data modifications are likely, DVC is very useful. For instance, if we were to acquire additional images or explore different preprocessing techniques, DVC could help with managing dataset versions.</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to be able to checkout different data versions, as part of being able to reproduce experiments. Of course, the hyperparameters, including the random seed, used to train a model, are important for reproduceability. But the data used as input is also extremely important. If we were to test how different preprocessing techniques affect model performance, DVC could help with this.</p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test</strong>
<strong>multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of</strong>
<strong>your github actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running</em>
<em>... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 11 fill here ---</p>
<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To configure experiments we used a combination of config files and CLI arguments, with an option for using Weights&amp;Bias Sweeps. The config.yaml file in the config folder holds some default hyperparameters, and running the training without any command line arguments results in the experiement being run with the default parameters: <code>python train_model.py</code></p>
<p>To overwrite the parameters directly for a single run, additional arguments for any of the hyperparameters can be provided: <code>python train_model.py learning_rate=0.01 batch_size=32</code>.</p>
<p>To configure a sweep, the developer should create a sweep.yaml file in the config folder and run: <code>wandb sweep sweep.yaml</code>.</p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's challenging to guarantee that no information is lost, but we implement practices to enhance reproducibility. We employ configuration files to systematically define experiment parameters, providing a clear and documented blueprint for each experiment. This minimizes the risk of oversight and aids in recreating experiments precisely.</p>
<p>We also use the Weights and Biases (W&amp;B) platform to log comprehensive details of our experiments, including hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts. This not only facilitates result tracking but also enables others to replicate our experiments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we containerize our training environment using Docker. By encapsulating dependencies and configurations within a Docker container, we create a standardized and isolated environment. This ensures that anyone, regardless of their system configuration, can reproduce our experiments consistently. Through this combination of configuration files, W&amp;B logging, and Docker containerization, we achieve reproducibility of our experiments.</p>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:
In our experimentation, we monitor several metrics to gauge the performance and effectiveness of our models. Firstly, we track the training loss, which provides insights into how well our model is learning from the training data. A decreasing training loss indicates that the model is converging and effectively minimizing the difference between predicted and actual values. This metric is crucial for assessing the model's training progress and identifying potential issues, such as overfitting or underfitting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Validation accuracy is another important metric we monitor. It measures the model's performance on a separate dataset not used during training, giving an indication of its generalization capabilities. A high validation accuracy signifies that the model is good at making accurate predictions on unseen data.</p>
<p>Additionally, since one of our group members has a GPU, we can also track GPU utilization. This metric can show how efficiently the model/training is utilizing available hardware resources. Optimizing GPU utilization ensures that computational power is maximized, contributing to faster training times and more effective utilization of hardware capabilities. By itself, GPU util only gives an indication of how the program is running, and should be combined with profiling tools to actually inspect and understand what operations are being executed and for how long.</p>
<p>By comprehensively tracking these metrics using the Weights and Bias framework, we gain a comprehensive understanding of our model's performance, enabling informed decisions and iterative improvements throughout the development process.</p>

<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 15 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When encountering bugs during our experiments, we adopted a systematic approach to debugging. We utilized the Python debugger, leveraging the <code>breakpoint()</code> method to inspect variable values and trace the flow of our code. To expedite the debugging process, we streamlined our experiments, limiting them to a single epoch, one data batch, and one validation batch. This allowed for faster iterations and pinpointing specific issues.</p>
<p>While we acknowledge that our code is not flawless, we haven't implemented profiling. We recognize the potential benefits of profiling tools in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance. Profiling can offer valuable insights into the runtime behavior of our code, helping address inefficiencies and enhance overall execution.</p>

<h3>Question 22</h3>

<p><strong>Did you manage to deploy your model, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and</strong>
<strong>preferably how you invoke your deployed service?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which</em>
<em>worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call</em>
<em><code>curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"&lt;weburl&gt;</code></em></p>

<h3>Question 23</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how</strong>
<strong>monitoring would help the longevity of your application.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could</em>
<em>measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monitoring will help the longevity of our application by providing valuable insight into how the users are actually <em>using</em> the app. There might be a great incoherence between the intended usage of the deployed model, and the actual usage. Monitoring is a way to discover this, because without it, how would we ever know what is going on in production?</p>
<p>Our app classifies images into 10 different categories of animals. There are obviously many more types of animals. And even more types of things in general. But that does not restrict users from uploading images of vintage cars and get respones like "cat" og "giraffe". And while it may be fun to find out if your friends car is more cat than giraffe, it may also be an indication that users actually want to classify cars moreso than animals.</p>
<p>This insight can be used to strategize and plan future development of the product. Without the monitoring, we might have thought that users wanted a greater variety of animals, but based on the monitoring we can make data-driven decisions that enhance the user experience in the future.</p>
